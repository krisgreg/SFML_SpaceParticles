# SFML_SpaceParticles

A small personal project inspired by the creation of solar systems.

I was wondering how and why solar systems formed just from a lot of particles being in the same area of space.
I did some research into how objects exert gravity on eachother and implemented particles which did just that.

The simulation spawns in an amount of particles within a set 2D area, lets all of them interact through gravity, and merges particles that gets too close.

I was amazed at seeing this actually form something that resembled a solar system on the first try, with only 50 particles.

I've not exactly put much effort into optimizing this, but it is possible to run about 2'000 particles (with a lot of lag early in the sim).

### Example of a 500 particle simulation.
